/* Step 18
When the user inputs their daily calorie budget, the input field will only accept numerical values. However, if a number is entered with a + or - sign, you'll need to remove those characters.

Start by declaring a cleanInputString function that takes a str parameter.

NOTE: Values from an HTML input field are received as strings in JavaScript. You'll need to convert these strings into numbers before performing any calculations. Converting string values into numbers will be covered in a future step. */
