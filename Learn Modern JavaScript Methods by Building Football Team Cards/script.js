The next step would be to display the word (Captain) next to the player if they are listed as a captain for the team.

Before the ${name} expression, add a new embedded expression. Inside that expression, use a ternary operator to check if isCaptain is true. If so, return "(Captain)" otherwise return an empty string.*/
